{"problem":"Two masses are connected to each other and the tip of a rotating rod by massless strings as shown. The mass (10kg) closer to the rod travels in a circle of radius 1 meter, with its axis being the rod. The mass (10kg) further away travels similarly in a circle of radius 2 meters. If the angular velocity of the two masses is sqrt(10) radians per second, find the tension in the string connecting the rod to the mass closest to it.
