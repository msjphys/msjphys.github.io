  Welcome to the MSJ Physics Club website! We are a new non-ASB-affiliated club (as of now) dedicated to spreading physics knowledge throughout the school. 
  Currently, we create worksheets that are good for practicing for the <em>F=ma</em> contest (and USAPHO), and may be helpful for those of you taking AP Physics 1
  or AP Physics C. <br/><br/> You may navigate through our website using the navigation circles in the top-left corner. On this website, we have a growing number of
  physics worksheets. Solutions are available, too.<br/><br/>
